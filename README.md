# definitely-super-secure-password-generators
Some "secure" password generators from the Iowa State University ISEAGE competition.  Yes, this is a joke.  It was the ~roughly~ same program written in a bunch of different languages

Here are *my* updated rules for this:
* Any programming language that can be effectively interpreted by an x86 computer are allowed. 
  * Other architectures (MIPS, 68000, ARM, etc.) must be put into a folder with their corresponding architecture and programming language. 
* The scripts and programs MUST include the word "password" and starting at the number one going up forever.  There MUST also be a new line after every word.
  * `password1`
  * `password2`
  * `password3`
  * `password4`
  * And so on...
* Pull Requests should be in a readable format saying what languages are being added
  * For example... "[Username]-C-Python-JavaScript"
* I'll add more as I figure more out.

For now we have:
* C
* C++
* Python
* Java
* BrainF$ck

Coming soon:
* Assembly
* JSF$ck
* JavaScript
* D
* CoffeeScript
* Anything else anyone can make!
